> Note: The demo video shows slower processing due to CPU-only execution. Performance significantly improves with GPU acceleration.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for fast and accurate product detection
- **Automated Billing**: Automatically generates bills based on detected items
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive web interface built with Streamlit
- **Smart Tracking**: Prevents duplicate item scanning with cooldown system
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time FPS monitoring and detection statistics
- **PDF Bill Generation**: Creates professional PDF bills for transactions

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Webcam or video input device

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone   git clone https://github.com/SripadhiDeekshith/GroceryCheckoutSystem.git

cd GroceryCheckoutSystem
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## üí° How It Works

1. The system uses your camera feed to detect products in real-time
2. When a product is detected, it's added to the bill after a cooldown period to prevent duplicate scanning
3. The total is automatically calculated and displayed
4. Generate a PDF bill when the transaction is complete
